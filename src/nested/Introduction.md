# Introduction

Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a scalable, decentralized neural network. The system is designed to incentivize the production of artificial intelligence by training models within a blockchain infrastructure and rewarding performance with a custom digital currency. 

The network is composed of several thousand nodes, each containing a machine learning model. All nodes are assigned the task of parsing a massive collection of text data, working collaboratively to extract semantic meaning. By way of a consensus mechanism, the system is designed to reward the most value-producing nodes, such that the digital token reaches equivalency with the quality and quantity of representational knowledge in the system.

Ultimately, our vision is to create a pure market for machine intelligence.
